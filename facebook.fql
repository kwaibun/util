Unlike your smart lists for your work, school, family and city, we don't create Close Friends and Acquaintances lists for you. Since these types of relationships are unique, it's important for you to decide who goes in your Close Friends, Acquaintances or Restricted lists -- if you use them at all.

Important: You cannot expose this information to anyone but the logged-in user, as it is private and to do so would break our Platform Policies
You cannot use a user’s friend list outside of your application, even if a user consents to such use, but you can use connections between users who have both connected to your application.
